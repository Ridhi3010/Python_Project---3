# Python_Project---3
This Python project predicts gold prices using machine learning. It preprocesses data, analyzes correlations, and applies a Random Forest Regressor for modeling. Performance is evaluated using R-squared error, and the results compare actual vs. predicted prices, visualized with plots.
